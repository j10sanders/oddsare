# Odds Are

"Odd's Are" is a great/stupid/fun game that someone wrote about here: http://www.selassid.net/games/games/odds-game.html

I've made a web app version that has two main benefits:
 1. This stores your past games so stats can be analyzed (and I'll be adding functionality).
 2. You can send dares to friends without needing to be in their immediate vicinity, or without saying your odds out loud in a public space.
 
## Play it!
